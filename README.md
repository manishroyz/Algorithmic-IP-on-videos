# Algorithmic-processing-of-moving-objects-in-videos
In this project various algorithms for tracking moving objects are implemented and subsequently used for identification of semantically distinct regions from videos.   

Incrementally implemented and explored Image processing algorithms for : <br/>
• Enhancement in the spatial & frequency domain <br/>
• Application of morphological operators & semantic classification using Image Segmentation <br/>
•	Utilized Image pattern classification (Bayes, Deep Learning) <br/>
